# Week 8 Quiz

## **Imaging Technique Inspiration**

#### A source of inspiration for the group assignment is TeamLabâ€™s artwork, which takes *lights* and *shapes* to create a dynamic and immersive artwork. The shapes they use are not always sophisticated or difficult to recreate but their use of vibrant colors and the way the simple shapes move around creates unique pieces. Drawing from their approach will help develop a dynamic and engaging artwork. The combination of colours, light and shadow adds depth, and the movement of shapes will help create immersive artwork. Adding user input animation will also make it an interactive and original artwork.

## **Coding Technique**

#### Coding techniques that can be implemented to achieve such art are dynamic color changes, interval-based animation updates and mouse interaction. Not only colors but adding hue, saturation and lightness will create dynamic and unique colors that will be eye-catching. The animation loop will consistently update the canvas and make the pattern enabling the update to be smooth in response to user actions. Mouse interaction will make the art more interactive and engaging for viewers.
